        <h2>Trip Cancellation</h2>
        <img src="images/trip cancellation.webp" alt="">
        <p>One of the most popular types of travel insurance is trip cancellation. Just be sure you know what you are buying.

        “Across the board, the biggest mistake [people make] is not understanding the coverage,” said Megan Moncrief, chief marketing officer of Squaremouth, a website that compares travel insurance.
            
        The most comprehensive coverage is “cancel for any reason” — as in, if you change your mind — but it comes at a price. Expect to pay about 50% more. Generally, you’ll get about 75% of your trip reimbursed.
            
        There are also policies with a variety of exclusions. What most people look for is insurance that allows them to cancel their vacation in case of injury or illness, or if there is bad weather, such as a hurricane. Expect to provide a doctor’s note for any medical claims.</p>
